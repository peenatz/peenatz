- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @peenatz
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Photography, Coding and recently I've found myself interested more and more in creative coding, a way to drive together two of my major interests.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently studying as much coding languages as I can, together with being a University student minoring in Communications Studies. 
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: if you are interested, you can drop a few lines in my inbox on here or send me an email at cigarettesaftrsx@gmail.com
